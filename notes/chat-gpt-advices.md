Study quantitative finance: Quantitative finance is a field that combines finance, mathematics, and computer science. It's essential for developing trading algorithms. You can learn about quantitative finance through online courses, textbooks, or blogs.

Play on historical data: Playing on historical data can be a great way to understand patterns and structures in the markets. You can use platforms such as TradingView or Backtrader to backtest your strategies.

Start learning technical analysis: Technical analysis is the study of price charts and patterns to predict future price movements. It's a popular approach in trading and can be used in conjunction with algo trading. You can learn technical analysis through books, online courses, or webinars.

## TA Indicators
```
There are many technical analysis indicators that traders use to analyze financial markets, but here are some of the most commonly used ones:

Moving Averages (MA): This is a commonly used indicator that shows the average price of an asset over a certain period of time. Traders use moving averages to identify trends and potential entry and exit points.

Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a momentum indicator that compares the size of recent gains to recent losses in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions of an asset.

Bollinger Bands (BB): Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that measure the volatility of an asset. They are formed by plotting two standard deviations away from a simple moving average.

Stochastic Oscillator: This is another momentum indicator that measures the relationship between an asset's closing price and its price range over a given period of time.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset's price.

Fibonacci retracement: The Fibonacci retracement is a popular tool used by traders to identify potential levels of support and resistance based on the Fibonacci sequence.

Ichimoku Cloud: The Ichimoku Cloud is a comprehensive indicator that shows support and resistance levels, momentum, and trend direction.

Average Directional Index (ADX): The ADX is a trend indicator that shows the strength of a trend.

On-balance volume (OBV): This is a volume-based indicator that uses changes in trading volume to identify potential trends in an asset's price.

Williams %R: Williams %R is a momentum indicator that shows overbought and oversold conditions of an asset. It is similar to the RSI but uses a different formula.
